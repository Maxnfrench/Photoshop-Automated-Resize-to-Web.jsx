=====================================

This is a script for Photoshop that batch processes on all supported filetypes (jpg, jpeg, tif, psd) in the chosen directory to be web ready. The script outputs the new files to the .jpg filetype. The only saving method is "Save for Web...", there is no print quality exporting with this script. The accepted filetypes: jpg, jpeg, tif, psd.
